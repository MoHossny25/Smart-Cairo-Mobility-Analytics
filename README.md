## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Cairo Mobility** project is a comprehensive data analytics solution designed to provide actionable insights into Cairo's transportation ecosystem. By integrating data from Metro ridership, private car trips, and driver performance, this dashboard helps visualize urban movement patterns and operational efficiency.

## 📊 Key Insights & Dashboards
The project consists of several specialized reporting layers:

* **Executive Summary:** High-level KPIs including total booking value (209.5K), total trips (1,000), and customer reach.
* **Metro Ridership Analysis:** Insights into station traffic, showing **45M total passengers** with top stations like Sadat, Maadi, and Ramses.
* **Trip & Operational Efficiency:** Quarterly and annual trends, peak booking days, and top start locations (e.g., 6th October, Maadi).
* **Driver & Vehicle Performance:** Analysis of driver ratings, top car brands (Hyundai, Toyota, Kia), and revenue per vehicle type.
* **Customer Demographics:** Behavioral analysis based on age categories (Adults being the majority at 42%) and preferred payment methods (Cards vs. Wallets).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling and interactive visualization.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For advanced calculations and business logic.
* **Power Query:** For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and data cleaning.
* **Figma/Canvas:** For UI/UX dashboard background design.

## 📈 Featured Visuals
* **Time Series Analysis:** Monthly passenger trends and trip growth.
* **Geospatial Insights:** Performance analysis by Cairo districts.
* **Performance Matrices:** Detailed tables showing booking values and trip durations.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `/Reports`: Contains the `.pbix` file.
* `/Screenshots`: High-resolution images of the dashboard pages.
* `/Data`: (Optional) Sample datasets used for the analysis.
